  // Naukri-inspired job-card shadow, scaled down from the original
  // naukri.com mobile audit (0 14px 40px rgba(30,10,58,0.1)) — the original
  // needed 26px of clearance above every card to fade out cleanly, which
  // forced a title-to-carousel gap wider than it should be. Shrunk once
  // already to 0 8px 24px, then shrunk again to 0 4px 12px at the same
  // alpha: still reads as a clear "lifted card" shadow, just noticeably
  // tighter, so the clearance it needs (see [cardBuffer]) shrinks with it —
  // the 24px version needed an asymmetric 16px-top/32px-bottom buffer to
  // avoid a hard-clipped edge in a horizontal card lane; this size needs
  // only 16px on *both* sides, which is what let every section-to-section
  // gap on the home feed collapse back to a single, tighter 16px rhythm
  // instead of ballooning to 32 to stay shadow-safe. Cards get their
  // separation from this alone, no border, which is why every card-style
  // widget switched from Border.all(AppColors.border) to this shadow.
  //
  // Alpha bumped 0x1A -> 0x33 (~10% -> ~20% opacity) after live feedback
  // that cards barely read as elevated against the app's own white page
  // background. Deliberately the only lever touched here — blurRadius/
  // offset stay exactly as they were, so [cardBuffer] (derived from those
  // two) and every carousel-lane file that sizes itself off it need no
  // change at all.
