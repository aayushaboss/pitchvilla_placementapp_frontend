/// Auto-advancing carousel with dot indicators, looping in one direction
/// only. Built on `PageView.builder` with a very large virtual page range
/// (`itemBuilder` resolves every index back to a real card via `i %
/// cards.length`) rather than a small fixed page list — the timer just
/// keeps calling `animateToPage(current + 1)` forever, so every transition,
/// including the wrap from the last real card back to the first, is a
/// genuinely different index producing genuinely real content. There's
/// never a "wrap" case needing a jump/reset, which is what an earlier
/// version of this widget did (a phantom duplicate-of-first page + a hard
/// `jumpToPage(0)` once the animation landed on it) — that trick had a
/// real, confirmed glitch on exactly that transition: `jumpToPage`
/// synchronously re-triggers `onPageChanged` (a second rebuild inside the
/// same transition), and with no `key` on any page, Flutter can't treat
/// the phantom page and the real first page as the same identity across
/// rebuilds, so the hard offset snap wasn't guaranteed to land on a frame
/// boundary matching the eased animation's true rest position.
