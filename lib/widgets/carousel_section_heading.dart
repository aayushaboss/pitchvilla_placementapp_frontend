/// Heading for a horizontal carousel row on the feeds — plain black title,
/// 16px, an optional grey count following it. Carries its own top clearance
/// so every carousel on the feed reads as a separate block from the one
/// above it, not just a heading floating directly above a card row. This is
/// the single place that gap lives — callers should NOT also add their own
/// inter-section SizedBox before a carousel, or the gap doubles.
///
/// No divider — a previous version had one above the title, but paired with
/// a heading immediately underneath it read as two competing section
/// markers for the same break. The top padding alone is the separation now.
